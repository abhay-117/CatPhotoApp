# Cat Photo App 🐱

This is a basic HTML and CSS project built as part of my learning journey through [FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/).

## 📚 What I Learned

- Basic HTML structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Semantic tags (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`–`<h3>`)
- Linking to external pages using `<a>` with `target="_blank"`
- Using `<img>` with `alt` attributes for accessibility
- Lists: `<ul>` and `<ol>`
- Grouping content with `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- Intro to void elements like `<meta>` and self-closing tags
